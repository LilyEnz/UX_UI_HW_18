            <h2>Visual Design</h2>
            <p>
                With a minor in graphic design and over 
                8 years of experience applying the graphic design 
                principles in my current day to day work I am confident
                in my visual design skills. I have a passion for design and am 
                proficeint in the Adobe Creative Suite.

            <h2>Prototyping</h2>
            <p>From rough thumbnail sketches to hi-fi prototypes, I am
                experienced in creating clickable and functional prototypes to
                express my ideas. Using Figma and Adobe XD I can create clickable 
                prototypes for anything from responsive websites to
                mobile apps, and more.

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>
                Research is one of the most important tools in a 
                UX designers tool belt as it give quantitative data to 
                back up their claims. Using my interview skills I can gather
                qualatiative data to learn more about the users' problems. With 
                surveys I can quickly gather quantitative data. User testing is also
                in my skillset and needed to gather good feedback from users to improve
                my designs.
